unstaged work ne stash kari save karvu. free
if do not want to commit thw work in branch and try to switch branch then
uncommited work may be come in that branch or git will not allow us to switch the branch.

so we can stash the work at that point and switch the branch.
if we dont want that the changes come with us.

stash uncommited work so that we can return to them later, without having to make unnecessary commits.

git stash or git stash save for saving uncommited work. 
git stash pop for take changes back.

git stash  
git stash save 
git stash pop 
git stash apply will apply changes and changes also will be in the stash 
so we can apply changes at multiple places.

git stash apply will also generate merge conflicts same as git merge.
git stash list for list all stashed changes.

stash is array of stashed changes. pop means last change we
can apply changes for arr[2] andd so on.

git stash apply stash@{2}

git stash drop stash@{2} for dropping changes.

git stash clear for clearing whole stash

head refers to current branch last commit

git checkout commit#hash 
so now we will be in deteched head and if we do git switch master the deteched head will be fixed.

deteched head is used to create branch from that commit in past so it it very used.

do git checkout commit#hash and create branch to continue from there.

git checkout HEAD~1 commit before HEAD (parent commit)
git checkout HEAD~2 commit before HEAD (grandparent commit)

we can goto that commit without using commit hash. so relative commit is used.
