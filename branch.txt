different people work in different branch and then merge there code in main branch.

default branch on git is master branch
default branch on github is main branch

what is HEAD HEAD -> master
it is pointer to current branch we are on.

it is reference to last commit by default branch master branch last commit.

if we switch to different branch then last commit in that branch had head pointer.

git branch list all branches.
git branch <branch name> to create a new branch
it create branch but not switch to that branch


this is from the NEW-BRANCH branch.
=======
so head will be at both branches.

git switch <branch name> to switch to branch name

small command for add and message.

git checkout <branch name> to switch to branch name.

switch is new command and checkout is older command


git switch -c <branch name> to create a branch and switch to that branch
git checkout -b <branch name> to create a branch and switch to that branch.

switch c checkout b

without comminting changes we will not be able to switch to another branch

if we create a new file in branch and switch branch then that file will come with that switched branch.

git branch -d delete branch
git branch -D delete forced branch

we can not delete the branch we are currently on so go to other branch merge with master branch and then delete the branch.

git branch -m <name> to change current branch name to new branch name
so go to the branch that you want to change name and use git branch -m new name

-d to delete the branch
-D to forced delete branch no backup
-m to move/rename the branch

git merge <branch name>
that will merge <branch name> to current branch name

switch to destination branch and then git merge <branch name>
