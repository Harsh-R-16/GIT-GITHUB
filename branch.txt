different people work in different branch and then merge there code in main branch.

default branch on git is master branch
default branch on github is main branch

what is HEAD HEAD -> master
it is pointer to current branch we are on.

it is reference to last commit by default branch master branch last commit.

if we switch to different branch then last commit in that branch had head pointer.

git branch list all branches.
git branch <branch name> to create a new branch
it create branch but not switch to that branch


this is from the NEW-BRANCH branch.
=======
so head will be at both branches.

git switch <branch name> to switch to branch name

small command for add and message.
