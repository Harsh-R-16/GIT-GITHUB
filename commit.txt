git commit is different checkpoints.some changes between the two checkpoints known as commits.

group different files with changes in one commits

total 3 stages
1. Working directory
2. Staging area
3. Repository

we have made total 10 changes but we want to add only 6 changes to the repository
than we use git add to add changes to staging areravis

so git add is used to decide how many changes we want as next commit so we can decide that only this changes we want to add
working directory ma all changes
staging area ma changes that we want in commit.
repository ma changes that we have in staging area

git commit -amend
