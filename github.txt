use git clone for cloning existing git projects.

makesure that u are not in git repository before cloning git repo.

in code option green button copy link and git clone <url>


git remote -v to know existing remote in details
git remote to know existing remote in shorts.

git remote add origin <github repo link like we used in cloning>

origin is address of remote repository.

origin is common remote name we can also change this name.
git remote rename <old> <new>

default branch on github is main branch
default branch on git is master branch/

so if we dont want to change local master to main branch and want to 
push our master branch to main branch of git hub then use
this command git push origin master:main.
means that master of local repo to main branch of git hub

git push -u origin master
then it will set upstream so after we can just write git psuh so 
it will push current branch we are on to that equivalent branch to remote so no need to do git push origin <branch name>
again and again.

for all branches set upstream and then automatically current branch will be connected to remote branch at remote branch.
